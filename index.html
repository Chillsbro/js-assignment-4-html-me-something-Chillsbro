              <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My love for coding started when I moved to Kansas City from California.</br>
                I met a friend here, let's call him C-3P0. We met through a mutual friend.</br>
                We went disc golfing and C-3P0 brought up that he was working on a game.</br>
                I was intrigued that I could add sound effects with my music background, </br>
                and proceeded to show him a song of mine. He asked, "Who is this?" I said,</br> 
                "It's me!".</br>
                From there we collaborated for a bit with game design </br>
                testing, and implementing sounds. Seeing how he would create physics, </br>                                   
                movement, designs, and so much more through coding connected the wires </br>
                in my brain to finally see the connection between the logic and artistic side. </br>
                The fire was ignited, and ever since then I have set my goals on becoming </br>
                a professional developer and changing career paths to something I truly</br> enjoy.

                I started drumming at 12 years old, when my dad brought home an old electronic drum set. </br>
                I immediately sat down and started playing a simple beat. I had beatboxed a bit for fun, </br>
                so I think that helped me initially, funny enough. My dad is a concert pianist, </br>
                and had a band back in the 80's so we would frequently jam together and he would </br>
                help me with techniques, and dynamics. I taught myself from there on out, </br>
                played with a couple bands, and eventually started making music on my own. </br>
                It's been a blast, learning melody along with rythym, and envisioning journeys </br>
                to share through the medium of sound. For genres, as far as creating, </br>
                my favorites would be: Drum n' Bass, Chillstep, Electro, House, & Trance. </br>

                Disc golf is a newer hobby, but a great one nonetheless. </br>
                I've always enjoyed the outdoors, and competetion, which means Disc golf ticks the right boxes.</br>
                It has beautiful courses, and is fun and free to play. (Minus the costs of discs and a backpack, of course.) </br>
                I'm the type of person to sit and work for 10 hours straight without realizing, so this sport is a good break from that. </br>
                I've now replaced the gym with playing disc golf, and find that it reinvigorates my brain to work better each day. (like working out.) </br>
                It's healthy competetion with friends, along with much needed sunshine and a low intensity workout
